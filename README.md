# Welcome to my GitHub!

> Curious by nature, drawn to everything that bridges theory and reality. I’m interested in understanding and navigating complex systems through scientific rigor. I see research as a form of exploration and science as a shared language for making sense of uncertainty.

## What I do?

Currently, I am a [BSc student in Statistics and Computer Science for Business, Finance, and Insurance](https://orienta.uniparthenope.it/laurea-triennale/statistica-informatica-azienda-finanza-assicurazioni/) at University of Naples "_Parthenope_", where my research spans quantitative finance, machine learning, and applied statistics.

Alongside my studies, I serve as **President** of the [Parthenope Machine Learning Society](https://aldojacopovirno.github.io/parthenope-mls/). Through advocacy, collaboration, and hands-on initiatives, we create a space where students can explore artificial intelligence, data science, and quantitative methods while contributing to the broader goal of shared knowledge and collective growth.

My current research interests lie at the intersection of deep learning and quantum system modeling, where I explore how neural architectures can advance our understanding of quantum phenomena. More broadly, I am focused on developing algorithms that connect mathematical theory with real-world applications.
