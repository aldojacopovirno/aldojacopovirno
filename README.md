# Welcome to my GitHub!

Curious by nature, drawn to everything that bridges theory and reality. I’m interested in understanding and navigating complex systems through scientific rigor. I see research as a form of exploration and science as a shared language for making sense of uncertainty.

## What I do?

Currently, I am a **BSc student in Statistics and Computer Science for Business, Finance, and Insurance** at University of Naples *“Parthenope”*, where my research spans quantitative finance, machine learning, and applied statistics.

I am particularly focused on developing algorithms that connect mathematical theory with real-world applications, from financial modeling to data-driven research across multiple domains.
